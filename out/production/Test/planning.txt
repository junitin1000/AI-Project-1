initialize empty board
determine who goes first
ask for move from first player
attempt to add move.
each edge placed is part of 2 potential squares.
for each move, fully check both squares to determine if a square has been completed

if square out of bounds, no completion
if square in bounds and has all edges, completed
if square in bounds but not all edges,  not completed

if completed, add score to current player.
player turn remains the same, and ask for another move

if not completed, no score change,
so switch player turn, and ask for another move.

if no moves left, end game.
can keep track of based on number of edges and how many turns there have been

for each move, have to determine if an edge is already there, or if out of bounds
only need to keep track of who got which square for visual purposes, it doesn't actually matter for gameplay.

board is an array, need board to string function, has some extra space.

make move by connecting 2 dots, eg (0,1), (0,2)

coords word as x, y where x is the row and y is the column

sample board
  0   1   2
0 .   .   .

vertical edge
  0   1   2
0 .   .   .
      |
1 .   |   .

edge notation(coordinate order is reversible):
(1,0), (1,1)
or
(1,1), (1,0)

all vertical edges will have the same r value for both coords
for all vertical edges the c value of both coords will have a difference of exactly 1

possible square associated edges for any vertical edge (r, c1), (r, c2) where c1 < c2
    note: while edge notation is reversible, these modification coordinates
        are spefically for the notation of higher coord, lower coord. If instead
        using a lower coord, higher coord notation, simple flip the the order of
        modification coordinates

square 1:
(-1,0), (-1,0)
(-1,0), (0,-1)
(-1,+1), (0,0)

square 2:
(0,0), (+1,-1)
(0,+1), (+1,0)
(+1,0), (+1,0)



horizontal edge
  0   1
0 .   .

1 .___.

2 .   .

edge notation(coordinate order is reversible):
(0,1), (1,1)
or
(1,1), (0,1)

possible square associated edges for any horizontal edge (r1, c), (r2, c) where r1 < r2
    note: while edge notation is reversible, these modification coordinates
        are spefically for the notation of left coord, right coord. If instead
        using a right coord, left coord notation, simple flip the the order of
        modification coordinates

square 1:
(0,-1), (-1,0)
(0,-1), (0,-1)
(+1,-1), (0,0)

square 2:
(0,0), (-1,+1)
(+1,0), (0,+1)
(0,+1), (0,+1)
